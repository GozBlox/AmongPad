# How to Download AmongPad:
Currently **AmongPad** is under development and we are facing some bugs in the **source code**, before building the app we still contacting **Innersloth** details about what is **AmongPad** and how does it works so we make sure that the app is not against **Innersloth Terms of Service**, VirusTotal could detect this app is a malware because we are asking the **Users** for permissions that the app needs to work and becomes useful such as:
- Bluetooth: PS3+ Controllers supports Bluetooth HDI, and you can connect easily to your android by clicking **PS + START** in your PS3 Controller and **PS + SHARE** in your PS4 Controller and **CREATE + SHARE** in your PS5 Controller
- Overlay (Above the apps): this permission is required so you can place the keys(buttons/analogs) above actual Among Us Buttons
- ForeGround Service: the app needs this permission so the app can run in the background while playing Among Us inside AmongPad
- Accessibility Service: this permission is the important one, without it, the amongpad buttons will be not functionaly and the app will be useless to enable it:
  - Rooted Device: give amongpad this permission by going to **Settings ----> Accessibility ----> AmongPad**
  - Normal Device: Android 12+ Phones restrict this permission but you can give the app this permission easily by going to **Settings ----> Accessibility ----> AmongPad**, remember that if your phone Android 12+ its very restricted to enable this permission and dangerous
